# Notes

## Array
Definition: Container object that holds a fixed number (except in JS) of values of a single type.

- indexed, so it can be accessed quickly
- operations:
  - traverse
  - search (by index or element)
  - sort
  - update
  - insert
  - delete

## Linked List
Definition: Linear data structure where each element is a separate object.

- nodes linked together using pointers
  - key = value
  - next = pointer
  - head = start
  - tail = end
- need to traverse sequentially to access
- operations:
  - traverse
  - searh
  - insert
  - remove
- types:
  - singly linked
  - doubly linked - pointers in both directions
  - circularly linked - tail points to head and visa versa

## Stack
Definition: LIFO, last in first out data structure or FILO, first in last out

- example: stack of plates, the last plate you added (the one on top) is the first one you will remove
- operations:
  - push: adding/inserting to the top of the stack
  - pop: deleting and returning whatever's on top of the stack
  - peek: returning what's at the top of the stack without deleting it, check if empty, check if full
- use: implement function calls in recursive programming

## Queue
Definition: FIFO, first in first out

- operations:
  - enqueue: inserting an element at the end of a queue
  - dequeue: removing an element from the beginning of a queue
- use: used to implement priority queues
